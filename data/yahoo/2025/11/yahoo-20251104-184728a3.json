    "full_content": "The government shutdown now stands at 35 days and is tied as the longest in US history as economic pain points continue to mount.\nThis past weekend wasthe worst yet at airports, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned Tuesday that another week of shutdown could even force the administrationto close some of the national airspacein what he said could prompt \"mass chaos.\"\nMeanwhile the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which is received by roughly one in eight Americans, willpay partial food aid benefits, according to a Trump administration court filing on Monday.\nTrump added some confusion around that issue Tuesday whenhe posted on social mediathat benefits would \"be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed later in the day he wasn't referring to these immediate benefits, saying \"we're getting that partial payment out the door.\"\nEither way, these growing economic ripples appear to be having an effect on lawmakers: Senate Majority Leader John Thune suggested to reporters Tuesday that bipartisan talks may have the Senate \"close to an off-ramp.\"\nThis new momentum comes ahead of a Senate recess scheduled to start at the end of the week. The outlines of a possible deal are coming into focus, which could reopen the government — butperhaps only for a matter of weeks.\nOverall, flight interruptions have nowimpacted over 3 million passengers, an airline group says, and the delays continued over the weekend with new stoppagesseen Monday in Southern California.\nSaturday was also the beginning of an open enrollment period for healthcare programs run by Affordable Care Act exchanges. Premium increases there — with Democrats looking to extend enhanced government subsidies for those plans — are at the heart of the impasse as some premiums areset to double next year.\nRepublicans have said they will promise a healthcare vote on a specified date in the coming weeks in return for reopening the government now.\nIt remains to to be seen if that concession unlocks enough Democratic votes after the party has said for weeks that these two votes need to happen at the same time.\nRead more:How the government shutdown impacts your money: student loans, Social Security, investments, and more\nHere are the latest updates as the impacts of the government shutdown unfold.\nFrom Bloomberg:\nRead more here.\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Tuesday that if the shutdown continues for another week it could lead to chaos\" as well as a the potential need to close some of the airspace due to staffing issues..\nReuters reports\nRead more here\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) officials haven't been paid for weeks but have seen less disruptions this time around than during the last shutdown in 2018.\nAir traffic controllers are more in focus this time around and part of the reason for that switch —Reuters reports— is increased pay and job security that TSA officials have enjoyed in recent years.\nRead more here\nMultiple signs on Capitol Hill early this week pointed to the possibility that bipartisan talks toward an end to the shutdown are making progress.\nThere is (very cautious) optimism that at least a short-term end to the shutdown could be coming into focus as lawmakers look toward a recess that is scheduled to start at the end of the week.\nReuters reports on a change of tone:\nSemafor adds that talks are getting into details— most pressingly, how long to potentially keep the government open for this time:\nAn airline industry group said Monday that the government shutdown which began Oct. 1 has affected some 3.2 million airline passengers, in the form of delays and cancellations that can be traced back to a shortage of air traffic controllers,Reuters reports.\nAir traffic controllers are federal employees who are expected to report to work during the shutdown even though they aren't being paid. But many have started calling in sick, hence the shortage.\nAlso on Monday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Trump administration would close U.S. aviation if it looked like the shutdown was creating conditions making it too dangerous to travel.\nRead more here.\nThe Trump administration said Monday that it will partially fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in response to two judges who issued rulings requiring it to keep the nation's largest food aid program running.\nThe Associated Press reportson how the uncertainty for the most vulnerable Americans could continue.\nRead more here\nBetween Friday morning and Sunday night, there were 98 “staffing trigger” reports at FAA facilities, a new CNN analysis of Federal Aviation Administration operations finds.\nThis marks the worst weekend for air traffic control staffing shortages since the shutdown began .\nMore from CNN\nRead more here\nDays of legal wrangling over SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, could get some clarity soon. The Trump administration faces a Monday deadline to tell two federal judges whether it will comply with court orders to fund the program.\nThe Associated Press reports\nRead more here\nAs the government shutdown drags on, major US airports were seeing an uptick in flight delays on Sunday amid the ongoing shortage of air traffic controllers, Reuters reported.\nAir traffic controllers are among the federal employees expected to continue to work without pay during the shutdown, but many have called in sick, causing a ripple effect at busy airports like Newark. New York City's Emergency Management office posted to social media that travelers flying to or from the New York area should check flight status before heading to the airport.\nRead more here.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the Trump administration does not plan to appeal a court ruling ordering partial payments of SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, Reuters reported:\nThe USDA has said it has insufficient funds to pay full benefits to the 42 million low-income Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and the administration argued the USDA doesn't have the authority to pay the benefits while the government remains shut down.\nBut two judges in Providence and Boston have ruled the suspension of SNAP benefits was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to start paying full benefits by Monday or partial benefits by Wednesday.\nRead more here.\nAs millions of Americans faced an abrupt pause in their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP benefits this weekend amid the government shutdown, a federal judge in Rhode Island on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to start paying full benefits by Monday or partial benefits by Wednesday, citing \"irreparable harm\" if the benefits are not paid,Reutersreports.\nRead more here.\nSome government workers who have been furloughed because of the shutdown are having difficulty qualifying for and receiving unemployment benefits — possibly in part because the workers who would assist with processing approvals may have been furloughed themselves, the Associated Press reports:\nRead more here.\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune and other Republican senators brushed off President Trump's call to scrap the filibuster from Senate rules.\nVia Reuters:\nRead more here.\nFrom Reuters:\nRead more here.\nYahoo Finance'sPras Subramanianreports:\nRead more here.\nSome interesting commentary from Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investments.\nHe says Trump's call for Republicans to use the \"nuclear option\" and zap the filibuster from Senate rules amounts to throwing a \"hand grenade\" into the proceedings. Especially since it comes at a time when negotiations toward ending the shutdown finally seemed imminent.\nHere's Valliere:\nPresident Trump has called for Senate Republicans to eliminate the filibuster to force an end to the shutdown.\n\"THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE “NUCLEAR OPTION,” Trump posted on Truth Social.\nTrump's call throws a potential wrench into GOP leaders' carefully laid plans. Both parties have in recent years taken steps to erode the filibuster, a Senate rule that requires most legislation to abide by a 60-vote threshold. But both parties have stopped short of eliminating the rule, fearing repercussions upon losing control of the chamber.\nRepublicans hold control of 53 seats in the Senate. Most of the Democratic members have remained in lockstep with their party to block passage of bills that would end the shutdown, as the party has clamored for negotiations to extend expiring subsidies for Americans on Affordable Care Act healthcare exchanges.\nA federal judge in Boston on Thursday heard arguments on whether the Trump's administration can legally suspend food aid for millions of Americans amid the ongoing government shutdown as it has said it as it plans to do starting Saturday.\nU.S. District Judge Indira Talwani asked questions Thursday and is set to rule before the weekend.\nReuters reports\nRead more here.\nThe government shutdown continues to have a negative impact on the travel industry due to staff shortages.
