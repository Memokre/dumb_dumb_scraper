Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) is one of the worst-performing stocks on Wednesday.\nDeere & Company dropped its share prices by 5.67 percent to end at $469.87 apiece as investor sentiment was dampened by a cautious outlook for the next fiscal year amid the threats of tariffs, coupled with disappointing earnings performance in the full fiscal year.\nIn an updated report, Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) said that it expects ongoing margin pressures to continue toward 2026, albeit the threats would begin to bottom out during the said period.\nLOVE_CHOTE/Shutterstock.com\n“While ongoing margin pressures from tariffs and persistent challenges in the large ag sector remain, our commitment to inventory management and cost control, coupled with expected growth in small agriculture and turf and construction and forestry, positions us to effectively manage the business and seize emerging opportunities as market conditions begin to recover,” said Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) Chairman and CEO John May.\nIn the full fiscal year of 2025, Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) saw net income decline by 29 percent to $5.027 billion from $7.1 billion in the same period last year.\nNet sales and revenues dropped by 12 percent to $45.684 billion from $51.716 billion year-on-year.\n“This past year brought its share of challenges and uncertainty, but thanks to the structural improvements we’ve made and the diverse customer segments and geographies we serve, we were able to achieve our best results yet for this point in the cycle,” May said.\n“Our continued commitment to delivering customer value and focusing on operational efficiency enabled us to remain resilient and demonstrate the strength of our business,” he added.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of DE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.
